# coffee_shop
this is my project from university. The task was to create a desktop application, of our choice. I chose a coffee shop database, tracking users visits and staff accounts. it has admin privillges accounts and is connnected to a SQL database (not included in here). many improvements could be made looking back on it. However, i am very pleased with how it turned out with such a short period to plan, design and create the entire application.
